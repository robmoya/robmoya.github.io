Money laundering is defined as the process where the identity of the proceeds of crime is so disguised that it gives an impression of legitimate income. Criminals specifically target financial services firms through which they attempt to launder criminal proceeds without the firms’ knowledge or suspicion. In response to the scale and effect of money laundering, the European Union has passed Directives designed to combat money laundering and terrorism. These Directives, together with regulations, rules and industry guidance, form the cornerstone of our AML/CTF obligations and outline the offenses and penalties for failing to comply. Easybit is currently unregulated and does not fall within the scope of the AML/CTF obligations, the senior management have implemented systems and procedures that meet the standards set forth by the European Union. This decision reflects the senior management’s desire to prevent money laundering and not be used by criminals to launder proceeds of crime. </p> <div class=polciy-regulation> <h5>AML POLCIY & REGULATIONS:</h5> <p>The UK AML regime is set out in the following legislation and regulations:</p> <ul class=pl-3> <li> The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA), as amended by the: <ul class=p-0> <li>i.

This AML Policy sets out the minimum standards which must be complied with and includes: </p> <ul class=pl-3> <li> Appointing a compliance officer who has a sufficient level of seniority and independence, and who has responsibility for oversight of compliance with the relevant legislation, regulations, rules and industry guidance; </li> <li> Establishing and maintaining a Risk-Based Approach (RBA) to the assessment and management of money laundering and terrorist financing risks faced by the firm; </li> <li> Establishing and maintaining risk-based Customer Due Diligence (CDD), identification, verification and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, including enhanced due diligence for customers presenting a higher risk, such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs); </li> <li> Establishing and maintaining risk-based systems and procedures for the monitoring of on-going customer activity; </li> <li> Establishing procedures for reporting suspicious activity internally and to the relevant law enforcement authorities as appropriate; </li> <li> Maintaining appropriate records for the minimum prescribed periods; </li> <li> Providing training for and raising awareness among all relevant employees. </li> </ul> </div> <div class=pt-4> <h5>SANCTIONS POLICY:</h5> <p> Easybit is prohibited from transacting with individuals, companies and countries that are on prescribed sanctions lists.

You are responsible for: </p> <ul class=pl-3> <li>keeping your email address up to date in your Account profile </li> <li> maintaining the confidentiality of your User information and the security of your Account, which includes the enabling of all relevant security features. </li> </ul> <p> You agree to notify Easybit immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized use of the Services or any other breach of security regarding the Services.

We advise the regular use of a reliable virus and malware screening and prevention software. If you question the authenticity of a communication purporting to be from Easybit, you should login to your Account through the Easbit website.

It is important that you always protect not only your password but also the email account associated with your Account and any device used to access your Account.
